    ASYNC JS 

    We know that the default JS is Synchronous
                                   Single Threaded 

    But this is all default , now a days it is more advance that can handle async operations 


    #Blocking code v/s Non Blocking code 
            Blocking Code => Block sthe flow of entire program 
                             

            Non Blocking  => Doesnt block the excecution of code
